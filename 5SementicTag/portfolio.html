        Story:      Ravi, a bright student from a small village, walked 5 kilometers daily to attend school.
                    Despite limited resources, he topped his class with determination and hard work.
                    He studied under a kerosene lamp every night, dreaming of becoming an engineer.
                    His teachers and parents supported him, proud of his dedication.
                    Years later, Ravi returned as a successful engineer to build a school in his village.
